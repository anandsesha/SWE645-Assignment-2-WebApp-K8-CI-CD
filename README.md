# SWE645-Assignment-2-WebApp-K8-CI-CD
Containerized - Kubernetes Deployment - Complete CI/CD Pipline

# Objectives of this assignment:

• Containerize the Web application you developed in Homework 1 – Part 2, using
Docker container technology.

• Deploy the containerized application on the open source container orchestration
platform Kubernetes to enable scalability and resiliency of the application. Your
baseline configuration includes at least three pods running all the time. You can
use Rancher (https://rancher.com/docs) to setup Kubernetes cluster. You also have
an option to use managed Kubernetes services, such as EKS on Amazon Web
Services (AWS) or GKE on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

• Establish a CI/CD pipeline that includes a Git source code repository at GitHub, and
Jenkins for automated build and for the automated deployment of your application
on Kubernetes
